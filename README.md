### 1. Clone and visit the project
`git clone https://github.com/NotBoringCompany/nbc-webapp.git`

and then:


`cd nbc-webapp`
### 2. Install packages and dependencies
Either `npm i` or `yarn i`. 
### 3. .env variables **REQUIRED**
Please contact me for the .env variables as some of them are private. This step is **REQUIRED** to start the local host instance.
### 4. Run the instance
Once you've received the .env variables, run the following command:
`npm run dev`
and visit `localhost:3000` on your browser.
